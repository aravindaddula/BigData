Question 52: Parking Ticket Allotment
===========================================

Statement: 
Develop a parking lot ticketing component which will support have 3 types of parking spaces (small, medium, large) 
for cars and one type for Bikes. The number of spaces should be configurable for each type.
 Whenever a car or bike comes in, it will check for the availability based on parking history and either allocates the slot to 
the right car based on car size. Cars will be charged based on sizes, configurable. 
Below are the charges for Cars: 
[Small  $1/hrs, ($ 10/day) {$ 45/week}, medium  2 $/hrs. ($ 15/day) {$ 65/week}, large $ 5/hrs. ($ 20/day) {$ 80/week}].

Below are the charges for Bikes:
$1/hrs, ($ 8/day) {$ 35/week}

Guidelines
1. Any car driver or bike raider will interact 2 times with the system. While coming in for parking (system to check availability) and while going out (system to 
calculate payment)
2. While coming in for Parking, the system should accept few criteria  and return a parking lot number, if parking is available.
3. While going out, system should accept the parking lot number and provide the calculated amount to be paid.
4. Use the best programming practices and code coverage with Test cases.
5. The code should be extensible and configurable.
6. Provide all the assumptions made.
7. Any number of days beyond a week can be treated as a weekly rate. For instance, 8 days means the driver is charged with weekly rate for 8 days
