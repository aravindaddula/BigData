Skills to learn:
Prepare python interview
packed and unpacked, generators
,object,oops,map and its output,

********Tavant Second Round********:
1.spark optimizations that you have worked on.
2.how many connections you have opened with SQL Server.
3.issues you have faced while working with spark.
4.Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. 
If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

case1 : find the existed element and its index
case2: tell the not found element index
========
# case1 : find the existed element and its index
# case2: tell the not found element index

nums = [1,3,5,6]
def find_idx(num,tgt):
    if(tgt>num[len(num)-1]):
        return len(num)
        
    for idx in range(len(num)):
        if (num[idx]==tgt):
            return idx
    if num[idx]>tgt and num[idx+1]

# tgt>num[idx] loc idx+1

# get_idx=find_idx(nums,6)
get_idx=find_idx(nums,7)
print("Found Element at the index : ",get_idx)
